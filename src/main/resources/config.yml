# Global Detection Settings
# ----------------------------------------
# Default settings that apply to all entities unless overridden

detection:
  # Maximum range for voice detection (in blocks)

  # How smooth is the transition between min and max? (0.0 - 2.0)
  # 0.5 = linear falloff

# Explanation: Environmental Modifiers
# ----------------------------------------
#
# ENVIRONMENTAL MODIFIERS work by multiplying detection range and adjusting thresholds:
#
# Example 1: Cave (1.3x amplification)
# - Base range: 16 blocks → Effective range: 20.8 blocks
# - Base threshold: -40 dB → Effective threshold: -43 dB (easier to detect)
#
# Example 2: Forest (0.7x dampening)
# - Base range: 16 blocks → Effective range: 11.2 blocks
# - Base threshold: -40 dB → Effective threshold: -37 dB (harder to detect)
#
# Example 3: Cave + Thunderstorm (1.3x × 0.6x = 0.78x)
# - Base range: 16 blocks → Effective range: 12.5 blocks
# - Thunder masks sound, even in echo-prone caves
#
# STRATEGIC GAMEPLAY:
# - Sneak through forests during thunderstorms (0.7x × 0.6x = 0.42x range!)
# - Avoid caves and open deserts when speaking
# - Use weather to your advantage
#
# REALISTIC SCENARIOS:
# - Speaking in a cave: Zombies hear you from 20+ blocks away
# - Whispering in a dense jungle during rain: Only 4-5 block detection
# - Shouting in desert: Creepers detect from 22+ blocks
# - Normal speaking underwater: Only 10 blocks (muffled)

# ----------------------------------------
# Explanation: Hybrid Detection System
# ----------------------------------------
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# 1. Player speaks → Voice Packet is captured
# 2. Opus audio is decoded to PCM samples
# 3. Audio level is calculated in decibels (dB)
# 4. Environmental modifiers are applied (biome + weather)
# 5. If dB > adjusted threshold → Event is fired
# 6. Entities within modified range check detection probability
# 7. Detection chance based on distance and falloff-curve
#
# DECIBEL (dB) SCALE:
# -127 dB: Complete silence
# -100 dB: Extremely quiet (background noise)
# -60 dB: Quiet speaking/whisper
# -40 dB: Normal speaking (default threshold)
# -20 dB: Loud speaking
# 0 dB: Maximum volume (shouting)
#
# VOLUME THRESHOLD EXAMPLES:
# volume-threshold-db: -60
#   → Very sensitive, detects whispers
#   → Good for stealth servers
#
# volume-threshold-db: -40 (default)
#   → Balanced, normal speaking required
#   → Recommended for most servers
#
# volume-threshold-db: -20
#   → Less sensitive, only loud speaking
#   → Good for action-focused servers
#
# RANGE SYSTEM:
# After volume check, distance-based detection:
# - 0-2 blocks (min-range): 100% detection chance
# - 2-16 blocks: Smooth falloff based on falloff-curve
# - 16+ blocks (max-range): 0% detection chance
#
# EXAMPLE (default settings in forest during rain):
# Player speaks at -35 dB (normal volume):
# - Environment: Forest (0.7x) × Rain (0.8x) = 0.56x modifier
# - Threshold: -40 dB → -35.6 dB (adjusted)
# - Passes threshold (-35 > -35.6) ✓
# - Range: 16 blocks → 9 blocks (modified)
# - At 4 blocks: ~60% chance (instead of 90%)
# - At 8 blocks: ~20% chance (instead of 60%)
#
# Player whispers at -50 dB in cave:
# - Environment: Cave (1.3x) amplifies sound
# - Threshold: -40 dB → -43 dB (easier to detect)
# - Still fails threshold (-50 < -43) ✗

# Tuning Guide
# ----------------------------------------
#
# For STEALTH gameplay (hard to detect):
# - Increase min-range (e.g., 4.0)
# - Decrease max-range (e.g., 12.0)
# - Lower falloff-curve (e.g., 0.7)
# - Keep environmental modifiers enabled
#
# For ACTION gameplay (easy to detect):
# - Decrease min-range (e.g., 1.0)
# - Increase max-range (e.g., 20.0)
# - Higher falloff-curve (e.g., 1.5)
# - Disable environmental modifiers for consistency
#
# For REALISTIC gameplay (balanced):
# - Keep defaults
# - Enable all environmental modifiers
# - Adjust per mob category as needed
