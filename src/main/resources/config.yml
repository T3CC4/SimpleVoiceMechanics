# SimpleVoiceMechanics Configuration
# Plugin that makes mobs and sculk sensors react to player voice through SimpleVoiceChat

# ========================================
# Mob Hearing Settings
# ========================================
# Controls whether mobs can hear and react to player voices
mob-hearing:
  # Master switch for all mob hearing features
  enabled: true

  # Whether hostile mobs (zombies, skeletons, creepers, etc.) can hear players
  hostile-mobs: true

  # Whether wardens can hear players (increases anger level)
  warden: true

# ========================================
# Sculk Sensor Settings
# ========================================
# Controls whether sculk sensors are triggered by player voices
sculk-hearing:
  # Master switch for sculk sensor detection
  enabled: true

# ========================================
# Detection Settings
# ========================================
detection:
  # Maximum range in blocks for voice detection
  # Mobs and sculk sensors within this range can detect player voices
  # Valid range: 1.0 to 128.0
  hearing-range: 16.0

  # Minimum volume threshold for processing voice packets (0.0 to 1.0)
  # Lower values = more sensitive, higher values = less sensitive
  # This filters out very quiet background noise
  volume-threshold: 0.1

  # Minimum volume required for actual detection by mobs/sculk (0.0 to 1.0)
  # This is the threshold after volume calculation for entities to react
  # Should be higher than volume-threshold to prevent over-triggering
  min-volume: 0.2

# ========================================
# Notes
# ========================================
# - Players in Creative or Spectator mode will not trigger voice detection
# - Volume decreases with distance (linear falloff)
# - Sculk sensors have a 1-second cooldown between triggers
# - Wardens gain anger proportional to voice volume
# - All settings can be reloaded with /voicemechanics reload
